                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species
                and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for
                its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
                An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer
                and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
                social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
                which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its
                offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two
                years, then become independent and leave their mother's home
                range to establish their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once
                ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to
                the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the
                foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since
                the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93%
                of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western
                and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large
                areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's
                range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests
                to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent,
                Indochina and Sumatra.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of
                2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number
                between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the
                populations living in small isolated pockets. India currently
                hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population
                decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
                poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict,
                particularly in range countries with a high human population
                density.

                The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the
                world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the
                ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its
                historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and
                literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as
                mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of
                India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

                The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old
                French tigre, from Latin tigris. This was a borrowing of
                Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown
                origin meaning 'tiger' and the river Tigris.[4] The origin may
                have been the Persian word tigra meaning 'pointed or sharp', and
                the Avestan word tigrhi 'arrow', perhaps referring to the speed
                of the tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have
                any meanings associated with tigers.[5] The generic name
                Panthera is derived from the Latin word panthera, and the
                Ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[6] The Sanskrit word पाण्डर
                pāṇḍ-ara means 'pale yellow, whitish, white'.[7] Taxonomy and
                genetics In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work
                Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris.[2]
                In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock
                subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the
                scientific name Panthera tigris.[8][9] Subspecies Phylogenetic
                relationship of tiger populations based on Driscoll et al.
                (2009).[10] Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the
                species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as
                subspecies.[11] The validity of several tiger subspecies was
                questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the
                19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur
                length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence
                characteristics that vary widely within populations.
                Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and
                gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to
                have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was
                proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely
                P. t. tigris in mainland Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater
                Sunda Islands.[12] Results of craniological analysis of 111
                tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that
                Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger
                skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan
                tiger skulls. The authors proposed to classify the Sumatran and
                Javan tigers as distinct species, P. sumatrae and P. sondaica,
                with the Bali tiger as subspecies P. sondaica balica.[13] In
                2015, morphological, ecological, and molecular traits of all
                putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach.
                Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups
                continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition
                of only two subspecies, namely P. t. tigris comprising the
                Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and
                Caspian tiger populations, and P. t. sondaica comprising the
                Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also
                noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation
                management. The nominate subspecies P. t. tigris constitutes two
                clades:[14] a northern clade composed of the Siberian and
                Caspian tiger populations a southern clade composed of all other
                mainland populations. One conservation specialist welcomed this
                proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future
                rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One geneticist was
                sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently
                recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.[15]
                In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat
                Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger
                populations in continental Asia as P. t. tigris, and those in
                the Sunda Islands as P. t. sondaica.[16] This two-subspecies
                view has been largely rejected by researchers. Results of a 2018
                whole-genome sequencing of 32 specimens support six monophyletic
                tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and
                indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about
                110,000 years ago.[17][18] The following tables are based on the
                classification of the species Panthera tigris provided in Mammal
                Species of the World.[11] It also reflects the classification
                used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:

                recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.[15]
                In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat
                Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger
                populations in continental Asia as P. t. tigris, and those in
                the Sunda Islands as P. t. sondaica.[16] This two-subspecies
                view has been largely rejected by researchers. Results of a 2018
                whole-genome sequencing of 32 specimens support six monophyletic
                tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and
                indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about
                110,000 years ago.[17][18] The following tables are based on the
                classification of the species Panthera tigris provided in Mammal
                Species of the World.[11] It also reflects the classification
                used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:
