                                    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest
                                    living cat species and a member of the genus
                                    Panthera. It is most recognisable for its
                                    dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a
                                    white underside. An apex predator, it
                                    primarily preys on ungulates such as deer
                                    and wild boar. It is territorial and
                                    generally a solitary but social predator,
                                    requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
                                    which support its requirements for prey and
                                    rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay
                                    with their mother for about two years, then
