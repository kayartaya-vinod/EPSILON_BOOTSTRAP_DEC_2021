                    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat
                    species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
                    recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur
                    with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys
                    on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial
                    and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
                    large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its
                    requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger
                    cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become
                    independent and leave their mother's home range to establish
                    their own.
